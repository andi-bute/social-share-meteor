# Social Share Buttons

A wrapper package to use visualCaptcha with Meteor


```
mrt add social-share
```

You may now use the handlebars helper 

```
{{social-share '["facebook", "twitter"]'}}
```
It will use current URL for posting and also adding ``?_escaped_fragment_`` at the end for use with spiderable package.
